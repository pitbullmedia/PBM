The Jellyfin Roku App is a Jellyfin client for Roku Devices.  This is still very much a work in progress, so we would encourage you to [get involved](#get_involved) if you can.



## Getting Started
 **Stable Release (Recommended!)**

The full released version of the channel is available on the [Roku Channel Store](https://my.roku.com/add/jellyfin).

---
**Beta Release**

If you want, you can install the Beta version by clicking [here](https://my.roku.com/add/jellyfinbeta).


## Getting Involved<a name="get_involved"></a>

No matter what your interests or skill are, you can help to make this client better for everyone by simply using the client and letting us know if you find a problem with it.   Either give us a shout on [matrix](https://matrix.to/#/+jellyfin:matrix.org) or create a github issue.

Feature requests are always welcome too, but please have a read though the existing issues to see if someone has already raised one for something similar.

If you can live with a slightly less stable version of the client, then install the beta version of the client from the *beta release* link above and give us some feedback.

If you fancy some development, then read the [DEVGUIDE](DEVGUIDE.md) to find out the best ways to help.
